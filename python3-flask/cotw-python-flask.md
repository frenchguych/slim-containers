h1. Introduction to the Python-Flask Container

Today, we are going to be slimming a simple app housed in a container we built from the base Python 3.X image and leverageing Flask, one of the most common web microframeworks available. We build a basic sample app that merely takes a request url and returns a basic JSON response. This is a common pattern for building RESTful APIs and putting them in a container for repeatability and scalability.
