# Conatiner of the Week from Slim.AI
This repository collects code samples, articles, and more information about the Slim.AI weekly series. 

Each week, we optimize a new flavor of container â€” from popular web frameworks like Node, Django, and Flask to data science-y applications in R and Python to specialized home game servers like Minecraft. 

You can find us on [Twitch](https:/twitch.tv/SlimDevOps) walking through these examples and discussing what we learned.
