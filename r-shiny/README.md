## Our Sample App 




### Dockerfile
This Dockerfile was produced for this example by Eric Nantz of [R-podcast](https://r-podcast.org/) (thanks Eric!) and can be found at his [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rpodcast/). The build script starts with the popular Rocker R-Ver variety, makes some apt-get updates and then installs R Studio and Shiny before copying the `/service` app directory and relevant files like `app.R` into the image. It then exposes the port `7123` (common usage in Shiny applications) and runs the app using the `R` command via a Docker `ENTRYPOINT`. 

```
FROM rocker/r-ver:4.0.3
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y  git-core libcurl4-openssl-dev libgit2-dev libicu-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev make pandoc pandoc-citeproc && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN echo "options(repos = c(CRAN = 'https://cran.rstudio.com/'), download.file.method = 'libcurl')" >> /usr/local/lib/R/etc/Rprofile.site
RUN R -e 'install.packages("shiny")'

COPY service /opt/my/service
WORKDIR /opt/my/service

EXPOSE 7123
ENTRYPOINT ["R","-e source('/opt/my/service/app.R')"]
```

### Testing Original Container
``` bash
$ docker run -dp 7123:7123 --name shiny_container johnnyslim/slimtest:r_shiny
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
6eb18cdb23f8   johnnyslim/slimtest:r_shiny   "R '-e source('/opt/â€¦"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:7123->7123/tcp   shiny_container
```


## Slimming The Image :mechanical_arm:

```
docker-slim  build --target johnnyslim/slimtest:r_shiny --show-clogs  --include-path-file 'build_recipe/r_path_includes' --publish-port 7123 --http-probe=false
```

#### Using an include file
DockerSlim has several methods for flagging parts of the container that should be included no matter what. Multiple files, directories, or user:group designations can be flagged in the command line such as `--include-path /etc` or `--include-path /somedir/somelibrary`. Since R and Shiny have a fairly robust number of libraries that we're using in this example, we use the `--include-path-file build_recipe/r_path_includes` to load all of our "Don't Touch!" files to DockerSlim in a convenient format. 

For this example, we used the error logs produced by R and the Explorer tab in the [Slim Developer Portal](https://www.slim.ai/blog/slim-developer-platform-web-portal.html) to search for libraries, files, and directories required for our sample app to work. Future iterations of Slim.AI will further simplify this discovery process.
